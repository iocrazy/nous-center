# nous-center — Claude / AI agent notes

Single-admin inference infra. Production deploy = `backend serve frontend/dist` on
`:8000`, fronted by cloudflared tunnel `api.iocrazy.com`. vite dev (`:9999`) is
**local-only** for frontend hot reload.

## API endpoint vs UI route — DON'T MIX

| Need to hit | Use |
|---|---|
| Backend API | `/api/v1/keys`, `/api/v1/engines`, `/api/v1/services`, `/api/v1/workflows`... |
| UI route (browser address bar) | `/api-keys`, `/services`, `/workflows`, `/models`... |

The UI route `/api-keys` is the React Router path users see; the backend endpoint is
`/api/v1/keys` with no `api-` prefix. Calling `/api/v1/api-keys` returns 404.

## Operational

- Backend + cloudflared: systemd services. `sudo ./infra/systemd/install.sh`,
  then `journalctl -u nous-backend -f` for logs. Don't `nohup ... & disown`.
- Admin secrets: `./infra/security/gen-admin-secrets.sh > /tmp/secrets && cat /tmp/secrets`
  then paste into `backend/.env`. Three values: `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (browser cookie login),
  `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` (HMAC key), `ADMIN_TOKEN` (CLI bearer).
- Production frontend changes need `cd frontend && npm run build` after merge —
  backend serves `frontend/dist/`, not the source.

## Testing

- Backend tests run with `ADMIN_PASSWORD=""` forced in `tests/conftest.py` so the
  admin gate is off during the suite. Don't unset that.
- SPA catch-all is disabled in tests via `NOUS_DISABLE_FRONTEND_MOUNT=1`
  (also set in conftest). If you add a new test that registers routes after
  `create_app()`, this matters — otherwise the catch-all swallows them.

## Performance

- `/api/v1/engines`, `/api/v1/services`, `/api/v1/workflows` are wrapped with
  `@cached("prefix", ttl=30)` from `src/api/response_cache.py`. Any new write
  path that mutates these lists must call `invalidate("prefix")` (cross-resource
  writes pass multiple prefixes — see `workflow_publish.py`).
- ETag is computed on the serialized body bytes, not the dict — keeps it stable
  across non-deterministic dict/set iteration order.

## Memory
